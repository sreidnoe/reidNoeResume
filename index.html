              I have never failed an entire day of my life. I have, however,
              succeeded in finding out what has not been such a solid plan. I
              have been a single mother for the majority of my adult life, so to
              say that I am a creative problem solver is an absolute
              understatement. I have faced innumerable blockades, thus staying
              on my feet with multiple alternative routes to any given solution
              has always been in my repertoire. Now that most of my children are
              grown pursing their own dreams (College Volleyball Stars and Navy
              Damage Controlmen), I am finally getting the opportunity to invest
              and stay the course for my future. I am a philomath, a teacher and
              a coach. Mostly, I'm just a nerd.

                  I began this journey so that my children's skill level could
                  compete with those peers who's training was received from club
                  coaches. I since have coached many girls who have been awarded
                  honors such as: All South, MVP, All Conference as well as many
                  of them receiving the All Tournament Title on various
                  occasions. I was in charge of developing drills to strengthen
                  skills, I created camps, clinics, and hosted one on one
                  development. <br />
                  It was important to also nurture a well-rounded athlete. This
                  was ensured by instilling values, team work and most
                  importantly positive self-talk.

                  I had been a substitute teacher since 2015 for the Fairfield
                  school districts. This was Pre-K - High School including the
                  outlying special needs schools that were located out of
                  district. I ensured the continuity of education in the
                  educator's stead. There was not a reason for leaving, COVID
                  just put a damper on how much work was available and I decided
                  to pursue other revenue streams to supplement my income.

                  While attending nursing school through WGU, I freelanced as a
                  Biochemistry and Med Dose Tutor. An accomplishment that I
                  would like to highlight is that I devised an easier formula
                  that was more user friendly than Dimensional Analysis, Ratio
                  Proportional, and Formula Methods. It was used by the students
                  that I tutored to successfully pass their exams. I created
                  study plans based off of the individual's strengths and
                  weaknesses so a targeted tutoring helped them pass their test.
